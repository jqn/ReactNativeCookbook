# Getting Started

This section will help you install and build your first React Native app. We'll be using React Native CLI and this requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.
